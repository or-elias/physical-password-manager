# physical-password-manager
A complete design and threat model for the most secure password storage device ever created.


## What IF
What if us paranoids had a physical device we can completely trust? Not because we blindly trust a company, but because we understand how the device works.
Paranoid-HSM is a first of it's kind device, coupled with a first of it's kind software, built with a fully transparent design process.
Paranoid-HSM let's you, or anyone else, to understand both it's physical and software components up to the most detailed view possible.
When some things cannot be self verified by the user (you), it is clearly stateted, and equivalent replacments are suggested.
